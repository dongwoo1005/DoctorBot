NOTE: 
* Compared to Pizza example, the class Illness is like 'pizza', Disease is like 'pizzaBase' and Symptom like 'pizzaToppings'
* All named disease will go under 'Illness' class
* Can we change name 'Disease' -> 'DiseaseType' and 'Illness' -> 'Disease'?

TODO:
	- More datatype properties and restriction would be good.
	- Better Defined class and complex class? (if possible)
